			<p class="no-wolf">You're enjoying your date trememdously - the food is rich, the conversation is smooth and natural, and the music fits the mood just right. It's nearly midnight when you both realize how late it is.
				<br><br>
			"You've come a long way," says the gentleman. "The least I can do is offer you the guest room. I'll take you back home tomorrow."
			<br><br>
			You accept this generous offer, and find yourself looking out the window at the peaceful night, listening to the night creatures' songs. Your eyes begin to droop...
			<br><br>
		Your body jolts awake, and you're shrouded in darkness. Something is wrong. The curtains are drawn, and despite the thick covers, there's a chill in the room. Two silvery eyes are glowing in the darkness, the musty smell of unwashed fur staining the air, a blunt claw gently stroking your cheek.
		<br><br>
		"Why didn't you choose me?" he whispers, his rotten breath washing over your sweating face. "I told you in the beginning. To Date the Wolf, and Not the Others."
		<br><br>
		"But it's okay. I'll show you what will happen now."
		<br><br>
		The next morning, you are nowhere near your home, or your gentleman's home, but in the lair of a beast. You don't know where you are, or how long you will stay here, but he prowls around you, with those silvery eyes, wondering how best to savor you.
		<br><br>
		As time slips by, and you slip in and out of consciousness, the last thing you see is the sliver of a knife. The last thing you feel is the blade slipping across your neck.
		<br><br>
		BAD END.
